# ðŸ”€ Random Mail

**[Thunderbird add-on](https://addons.thunderbird.net/eN-US/thunderbird/addon/random-mail/) which adds a toolbar button to open a random mail from any folder!** (Excluding spam and trash.)

Very useful to clean up, organize, or just reminisce â€“ with the excitement of randomness.
